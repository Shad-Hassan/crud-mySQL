  "full_article": "Dr. Ali Afzal delivered an insightful interview on Biztalk, aired by ATN News. The host opened the discussion by highlighting the vital role of agriculture in Bangladesh, alongside the technological advancements and improved crop yields over the past five decades. As a guest speaker, Dr. Afzal was first asked how agricultural practices in Bangladesh could be enhanced to align with global standards. He began by sharing population statistics, noting significant growth over five decades and projecting a population of 1.45 billion by 2100. He contrasted this growth with the decreasing availability of land, affected by erosion and other geographical challenges. Dr. Afzal acknowledged Bangladesh's achievement in boosting food production to 40 million metric tons but noted a gap between this level and the claim of self-sufficiency, as the country remains reliant on imports. Compared to Western nations, he emphasized that Bangladesh continues to lag in agricultural development. Drawing from his experience as a scientist, Dr. Afzal attributed these challenges to flawed policies and a lack of integrity in research practices, despite substantial resources allocated to agriculture. He stressed that research should prioritize transparency and real-world applicability rather than academic pressures to publish and seek promotion. He also underscored that, despite Bangladesh's agrarian foundation and farmingâ€™s 11% contribution to GDP, concern is growing over the continued neglect of the farming community. In light of the political shifts of 2024, Dr. Afzal warned that further disregard for this vital sector could lead to significant unrest and destabilization. Farmers form a crucial backbone of the country, with one in every six people directly reliant on their work; he cautioned that their discontent could spark disruption with serious implications for national stability. Dr. Afzal further remarked that it is unfortunate agriculture has not been established as a separate commission, having outgrown its role as a business subset. Given its vast scale and critical importance to both the economy and national nutrition, agriculture warrants a dedicated commission. Establishing a properly designated body focused solely on agriculture and agronomy, he argued, is essential and without alternative.",
